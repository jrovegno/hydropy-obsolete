# UPDATE #
You should check this [new project developed by Stijn Van Hoey](https://stijnvanhoey.github.io/hydropy/).

# WARNING #
The `HydroPy` module is NO longer undergoing active development. There is an outstanding list of bugs that are unlikely to be fixed. A much better alternative of this module was implemented in [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). If you wish to see this module live on independently of `HydroPy`, feel free to fork the code and take it over.

`HydroPy` is a Python library for computational hydrology. It aims to become a full-featured computational hydrology while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. `HydroPy` is written entirely in Python and require some external libraries.
Work in progress!
